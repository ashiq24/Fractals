## Sample Interface

 Axiom: The initial string for the generation. \n Rules: A set of \
production rules. Input is taken in form of Python Dictionaries.\n Angle: Required Angle of roation for the fractals. \n \
 Side Length: Length of each side of the Fractals.\
\n Sample inputs for Koch-Snowflake are given in the Input box.\n \
 Sample input for Piano-Gosper-Curve is: \n \
                Axiom = FX\n \
                Rules = {\"X\":\"X+YF++YF-FX--FXFX-YF+\", \"Y\":\"-FX+YFYF++YF+FX--FX-Y\"} \n \
                Iterations = 4 \n \
                Angle = 60 \n \
                Side Length = 3"
